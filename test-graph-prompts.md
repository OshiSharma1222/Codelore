# AI Graph Generation Test Prompts

## Basic Graph Generation
1. "Show me the project graph"
2. "Visualize the architecture"
3. "Create a dependency map"

## Advanced Graph Features
1. "Create a project graph with modern theme and horizontal layout"
2. "Show me a colorful architecture diagram with animations"
3. "Generate a brutal-style dependency graph"

## Specific Graph Types
1. "Show data flow between frontend and backend"
2. "Create an API call relationship diagram"
3. "Visualize import dependencies"

## Layout Variations
1. "Create a vertical layout graph"
2. "Show radial layout of modules"
3. "Generate hierarchical architecture view"

## Expected AI Behavior

The AI should be able to:
- Automatically detect repository structure
- Create appropriate nodes with icons and colors
- Generate meaningful edges with labels
- Apply themes and styling
- Choose optimal layouts
- Handle different repository types

## Test Repository Types

### Next.js Full-Stack App
- Frontend (React components)
- Backend (API routes)
- Database (Prisma)
- Config files

### Node.js Backend
- Entry point (server.js)
- Routes/Controllers
- Services
- Database models

### Python Django App
- Django settings
- Views/Controllers
- Models
- Templates

## Success Criteria

✅ Graph renders with proper icons
✅ Nodes are positioned intelligently
✅ Edges show meaningful relationships
✅ Themes apply correctly
✅ Layout is readable
✅ Interactive features work
✅ AI responds to different prompts
